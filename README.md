# Protein-Hydrapathy-Table-Plot
# Project: We are given a fasta file with exactly one protein sequence and we want to get a csv file with three columns, amino acid, position, and hydrapathy value, as well as a plot for that.
#The general idea behind this script is to create  helper functions for different tasks (such as reading fasta file, hydrapathy calculation, cvs file generation and plot) and finaly we write a main function that takes all the helper functions  and arrange them so that we get the results as we want. Therefore, we first will have a read_fasta function that takes sequence as input and read the sequence, then calculate_hydrapathy that takes the output of the read_fasta and return the values for each AA individually, and finally a funtion to save the output of the hydrapathy for each protein in a csv file and a function to plot it.
